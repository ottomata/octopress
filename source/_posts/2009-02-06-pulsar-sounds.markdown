The [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/) at the University of Manchester has a really interesting [podcast about the sounds of space](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/pulsar/Education/Sounds/).  This video was stolen (without permission, sorry guys!) from their website.

From the Jodrell website:

> This is an animation of the Pulsars in globular cluster 47 Tucanae [...] with the pulsars occupying the 3D positions determined from timing observations. The sounds are the true sounds of the pulsars, but their images are rotating several hundred times slower than reality. [...] This beautiful globular cluster harbours 22 millisecond pulsars with periods between 2 and 8 ms. Many of them have a binary companion. We can estimate that hundreds more of these objects are in the cluster, but they may be too weak to be detected.

By "true sounds", I think they mean the sounds of the pulsar's rotational frequencies digitally translated into pitches.
