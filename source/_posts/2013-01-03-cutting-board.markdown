My two brothers and I were all home for Christmas this year.  While hanging around with Dad, I mentioned to him that I had been wanting to make a cutting board.  I had watched some YouTube how to videos on the subject, and while you should be able to make a nice cutting board without a big power planer, it sure is a lot easier.  Fortunately, Dad has one!

He had picked up this old planer from my Granddad's shop years ago.  It was probably made in the 1960s.  My Granddad also gave us a bunch of beautiful cherry and oak planks that had been milled around the same time.  So, we went out to the shop to start measuring and planning.

I wanted to make a board large enough for kneading dough, but Dad's planer blade is only about 12 inches wide.  We also tried to use up as few of the planks as possible.  My brothers all wanted to join in too.  We ended up measuring and realized that we could make 3 12" x 20" boards using only two or three of the cherry and oak planks.

Since the planks were milled so long ago, many of them were not flat.  We passed the planks through the planer a few times to eat off the warped surfaces.

Each board was to made up of alternating cherry and oak strips.  After planing the planks, we measured and cut and ripped them up into about 45 individual strips.

Next we lined up the strips, and started glueing.  Regular ol' wood glue did just fine.

We then clamped the glued strips together to dry overnight.

The boards rested on the pipe clamps while they dried, which left a nasty looking black stain on the wood.  We had planed to plane them again anyway, so we weren't to worried about the stains.  Glueing strips of wood together is bound to give you an uneven surface.  Into the planer with them!

After we were satisfied that they were all relatively flat, we sent them down the table saw one more time to chop off the ragged edges.

Dad broke out the router and grabbed a quarter inch corner routing bit.

We passed each edge of the boards by the router to give them a smooth edge.

All that was left was to sand and sand and sand, and then coat with layers of mineral oil.
