> Distance reminds us that there's a lot more to the universe than just 
people—that there's even a lot more to people than just people.  It reminds 
us that there are mental spaces inside our skulls as enormous as the spaces 
out there.  The experience of distance, of inner distance and outer 
distance, of distance in time and distance in space–it's the first and 
fundamental religious experience.  'O Death in life, the days that are no 
more'–and O the places, the infinite number of places that are not *this* 
place!  Past pleasures, past unhappiness and insights–all so intensely alive
in our memories and yet all dead, dead without hope of resurrection.  And the 
village down there in the valley so clearly seen even in the shadow, so real 
and indubitable, and yet so hopelessly out of reach, incommunicado.  A picture 
like this is the proof of man's capacity to accept all the deaths in life, all 
the yawning absences surrounding every presence.

– from *The Island* by Aldous Huxley
